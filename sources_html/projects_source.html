          <a href="https://gitlab.com/irakoton/tidy-automation">Tidy</a> was initially the name of a framework
          introduced in <a href="docs/22-ccs.pdf">one of my publications</a>, to specify security protocols whose
          security relies on time-based mechanisms (timeouts, verifiable delay functions...). I have been working on a
          tool based on these contributions during my post-doc at the Max-Planck Institute, and now develop and maintain
          it as a personal project.
          <br>
          <br>
          The tool acts as a front-end to the <a href="https://tamarin-prover.com/">Tamarin prover</a>, a
          well-established protocol analyser that does not support quantitative notions such as time. The Tidy prover
          uses its own (rich, typed, and timed) language, compiles it into a Tamarin specification. It then handles
          various rounds of interaction with Tamarin to construct an analysis of time-based protocols soundly.

          <a href="https://deepsec-prover.github.io/">DeepSec</a> (not the smartest name due to all of the homonyms and
          paronyms...) is a project contributed a lot during my thesis and the following years.
          This tool was designed as an analysor of privacy-type properties in security protocols with better
          performances and scope than its competitor at the time.
          I typically helped shaping the theory behind the tool, and contributed to the
          design and implementation of optimisation techniques that are now integrated.
          <br>
          <br>
          I happened to record my PhD defence, which includes a 5min demo of the tool's interface (see the extract
          below).

          This long-term project (<a href="https://project-everest.github.io/">here</a>) carried among others by
          Microsoft Research and Inria, focuses at producing formally verified implementations of the https ecosystem,
          mostly using the <a href="https://www.fstar-lang.org/">F*</a> proof assistant.
          This includes protocols such as TLS but also the IETF version of the QUIC protocol;
          I contributed to proofs of correctness and security of the latter (mostly of its packet encryption) in 2019.

            I have always liked to (try to) explain technical things in non-technical terms, which encouraged me to
            participate to various popularisation projects since the beginning of my thesis.

          <ul style="text-align:justify">
            <li>
              I participated to <a href="https://mt180.fr/"><em>Ma thèse en 180 secondes</em></a> (My thesis in 180
              seconds), the French iteration of a
              competition where PhD students present the challenges and contributions of their ongoing thesis to a broad
              audience in
              a limited time.
              You can see a live recording of my speech below (in French):

              Alongside with <a href="https://members.loria.fr/VCortier/">Véronique Cortier</a>, I also contributed to
              an activity explaining the challenges and daily-life implications of security protocols.
              This takes the form of an interactive riddle that targets audiences from children (we implemented it in a
              junior school in France) to curious adults (even researchers of other fields).

              We have also written a short paper (<a href="docs/21-guttman.pdf">How to explain security protocols to
                your children?</a>) to describe to other experts how they can deploy the activity themselves.
              A more detailed version, discussing in addition material questions and providing technical exercises to
              train a non-expert (math-teacher) animator, <a href="docs/crypto_teacher_training.pdf">also exists</a>
              (currently only in French).
